    localDescription: "Annapolis sits where the Severn River meets the Chesapeake Bay — which means waterfront properties, tidal influence on soil conditions, and the Historic District's additional permitting layer. Many homes here have compact yards that demand smart design to maximize outdoor living space. Bobby's crew has worked across downtown Annapolis, Eastport, West Annapolis, Hillsmere, and the Naval Academy-area neighborhoods.",
    topServices: ["Hardscaping", "Stamped Concrete", "Fencing", "Decks"],
    localAngle: "Properties near the waterfront often have high water tables and clay-heavy Coastal Plain soil, which means drainage has to be engineered into every patio and walkway — not bolted on as an afterthought. Bobby's team grades, compacts, and builds with these conditions in mind on every Annapolis project.",
    permitNote: "City of Annapolis fence permits require a scaled drawing showing the fence location, dimensions, and relationship to property lines. Properties in the Historic District need additional Historic Preservation Division approval before any exterior work begins. Waterfront properties may trigger stormwater review and Army Corps permits for work near the mean high tide line.",
    faqs: [
      { question: "Do I need a Historic District permit for a new fence or patio in downtown Annapolis?", answer: "If your property is within the Annapolis Historic District, yes — the Historic Preservation Division reviews all exterior changes, including fences, patios, and retaining walls. Bobby handles the documentation and coordinates with the city so you don't have to navigate it alone." },
      { question: "Can you build a patio on a waterfront lot near Spa Creek or the Severn River?", answer: "Absolutely. Waterfront lots require extra attention to drainage, soil conditions, and sometimes stormwater management plans. We've built hardscape and patios on waterfront properties throughout Annapolis and know exactly what the county requires." },
      { question: "What's the most popular outdoor project in Annapolis?", answer: "Hardscaping — patios, walkways, and retaining walls. Annapolis homeowners want usable outdoor living space, and with the compact yards common in neighborhoods like Eastport and West Annapolis, a well-designed patio makes the most of every square foot." },
      { question: "How long does a typical patio project take in Annapolis?", answer: "Most patio and hardscaping projects in Annapolis take 5–10 working days depending on size and complexity. Permitting can add 1–2 weeks upfront. We give you a firm timeline before any work begins." },

      { question: "Can you work on properties with steep slopes toward the Magothy or Severn River?", answer: "Yes. Sloped lots are common on the Broadneck. We handle grading, retaining walls, and tiered patios designed for sloped terrain. Proper drainage is built into every project." },
      { question: "What deck materials hold up best near the water in Arnold?", answer: "We recommend composite decking for properties near the rivers or Bay. It handles salt air, humidity, and UV exposure far better than pressure-treated wood, and it won't need staining or sealing every year." },

      { question: "My driveway in Pasadena is crumbling — can you replace the whole thing?", answer: "Yes. We tear out the old surface, re-grade the base, and install a new driveway — asphalt, concrete, or pavers depending on your preference and budget. Proper base prep is critical in Pasadena where a lot of the older driveways were built on inadequate foundations." },
      { question: "Do I need a permit to replace my fence in Pasadena?", answer: "In Anne Arundel County, fences over 6.5 feet require a permit. Even for standard fences, your property may have setback requirements or covenant restrictions. We handle the research and filing for you." },
      { question: "Can you build a gravel pad for my shed on a smaller Pasadena lot?", answer: "Absolutely. Tight lots are common in Pasadena and we build pads that maximize your usable space while meeting setback requirements. Proper drainage is especially important on compact lots." },

      { question: "What's the best patio material for Severna Park homes?", answer: "We see a lot of demand for natural stone pavers and stamped concrete in Severna Park. Both hold up well in Maryland weather and offer the premium look that matches the neighborhood. We'll show you samples during your estimate so you can compare options in person." },
      { question: "Can you build a deck that connects to an existing patio?", answer: "Yes — this is one of the most popular project types in Severna Park. We design the transition between deck and patio so it flows naturally, with proper grading and drainage at the junction." },

We prepare the required drawings and material specifications as part of our estimate process." },
      { question: "What fence styles does Crofton typically approve?", answer: "It varies by section, but most Crofton HOAs approve wood privacy fences (6 feet max) and aluminum/vinyl fencing. Chain link is typically restricted in front and side yards. We'll check your specific covenant before recommending materials." },
      { question: "Can you build a stamped concrete patio in a Crofton backyard?", answer: "Yes — stamped concrete is popular in Crofton because it gives you the look of natural stone without exceeding typical HOA height and material restrictions.

Fixing the drainage and building the patio together is more cost-effective than doing them separately." },
      { question: "Can you build on a newly constructed home in Severn?", answer: "Yes. New construction in Severn often comes with minimal outdoor finishes. We upgrade builder-grade fencing, add proper patios, install gravel pads for sheds, and handle all the outdoor work the builder left out." },

    localDescription: "Shady Side is a small, tight-knit waterfront community at the southern tip of the peninsula between the West River and Chesapeake Bay. It's one of the most remote communities in Anne Arundel County — a characteristic that means many contractors don't bother serving it. Properties are a mix of year-round homes and seasonal waterfront cottages, many on older foundations with yards exposed to bay winds and tidal influence. The community has a waterman's heritage and a relaxed, rural feel unlike anywhere else in the county.",

Being based in Millersville means Shady Side is within his service radius, and the community deserves the same quality work as Annapolis or Severna Park. Waterfront conditions here mean salt-resistant materials and drainage-first construction are non-negotiable.",
    permitNote: "Anne Arundel County permits apply. Nearly all Shady Side properties are within the Critical Area (1,000-foot buffer from tidal waters) due to the community's narrow peninsula geography. Most outdoor construction projects here will require Critical Area review and possibly a buffer management plan.",

Bobby's based in Millersville — Shady Side is within our regular service area, and we treat every project here with the same attention as any other community." },
      { question: "Is everything in Shady Side in the Critical Area?", answer: "Practically, yes. The peninsula is narrow enough that most properties fall within the 1,000-foot tidal buffer. This means additional review for construction projects, but we handle the paperwork and coordination with the county." },
      { question: "What materials hold up to bay winds and salt air?", answer: "We recommend composite decking, vinyl or aluminum fencing, and concrete or natural stone for hardscaping. Pressure-treated wood deteriorates much faster in salt air environments. We'll walk you through material options during your estimate." },
      { question: "Can you work on an older waterfront cottage in Shady Side?", answer: "Absolutely. Many Shady Side properties are older cottages that need modern outdoor improvements.

Its historic district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lots are typically compact — tighter than suburban developments in Crofton or Severna Park — and the neighborhood has a walkable, small-town feel.

Many properties have direct water access or are within walking distance of community beaches and marinas.

    faqs: [
      { question: "What decking material works best near the Bay in Riviera Beach?", answer: "Composite decking with stainless steel or coated fasteners. Traditional pressure-treated lumber breaks down rapidly in salt air. Composite costs more upfront but lasts significantly longer in waterfront conditions and needs almost zero maintenance." },
      { question: "Can you build a patio on a flood-prone Riviera Beach lot?", answer: "Yes, but the design needs to account for water. Permeable pavers, elevated patio designs, and proper grading that channels water away from your foundation are all options we use on low-lying Riviera Beach properties." },
      { question: "My fence is rotting from the salt air — what should I replace it with?", answer: "Vinyl or aluminum. Wood fences near the Bay typically need replacement every 5–8 years. Vinyl and aluminum are salt-resistant and last 20+ years with minimal maintenance." },
